        Welcome to TradingDuck, the ultimate platform for Pok√©mon card enthusiasts, collectors, and traders. At TradingDuck, we are committed to
        fostering a vibrant community where card aficionados can come together to exchange cherished items and share their passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we take pride in providing a robust platform, we'd like to emphasize that TradingDuck primarily acts as a connecting hub for traders. We
        do not directly participate in the actual card transactions. As such, the responsibility for verifying card authenticity, condition, and
        secure delivery rests entirely with the trading parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        We acknowledge that online trading can present certain challenges and risks. To ensure your trading experiences are safe and successful, we
        offer an array of invaluable resources. We highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with our 'Safety Measures', 'Trade Tips', and 'Card
        Authenticity Guide' pages before embarking on any transactions. These resources are carefully crafted to help you discern genuine cards,
        thwart potential scams, and ensure a seamless trading process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the interest of enhancing security and reliability, we strongly encourage traders to consider in-person trades in safe, public spaces such
        as reputable shops or malls. Face-to-face interactions can provide an added layer of trust and reassurance for both parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of a dispute between traders, we encourage open and respectful communication to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, you
        can contact our support team for assistance. However, please understand that while we are happy to provide guidance, the final resolution of
        the dispute lies solely with the trading parties.
      </p>
